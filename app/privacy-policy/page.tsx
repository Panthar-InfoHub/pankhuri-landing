            <p>
              The Pankhuri site is optimized for registered users. By registering, you can obtain benefits such as the
              opportunity to voice out your Opinions. If you choose not to register, you can still use some portions of
              the site. In that case, Pankhuri may obtain your IP addresses and by analyzing what URLs you came from and
              go to.

            <p>
              If you register, Pankhuri stores your preferences and passwords for your convenience, to provide you with
              a more personalized experience. At present Pankhuri does not use cookies to store your login sessions.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Your Registration Information</h2>
            <p>
              When you register, Pankhuri asks you for a number of pieces of information. If you register through a
              co-branded site, the co-brand partner may be transferring to Pankhuri some or all of the required
              registration information or possibly other information about you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Pankhuri uses registration information internally for a number of purposes, including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Email distribution as described in the Agreement, as you request on the site (such as promotional
                opportunities or newsletters if you check the applicable boxes on the registration page, and as
                described below in Section 9), and for administrative purposes (such as to notify you about changes to
                the Agreement or other problems with your account). In accordance with instructions on the site, you may
                opt not to receive certain emails in the future, and Pankhuri will use reasonable efforts to honor your
                request.
              </li>
              <li>
                Possible special opportunities, such as to become a featured reviewer, get extra exposure on the site.
              </li>
              <li>
                Display banner (and similar) advertising to you in connection with the site that is more targeted to you
                specifically. In doing this type of targeting, Pankhuri or its ad server, and not the advertiser,
                connect you with the targeting criteria.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              If you register through a co-branded site, Pankhuri may be required to give the co-brand partner some or
              all of your registration information to them. While Pankhuri will use such information in accordance with
              this Statement, it does not always control how the co-brand partners use or disclose such information.
              However, the co-brand partner is governed by their privacy policies. If you have any concerns about such
              privacy policies, you should contact the co-brand partner.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              You may request to cancel your registration to the Platform or request the removal of your registration
              information from member records for which permission may or may not be granted. However, Pankhuri will
              send you an email to confirm your request. After you respond, Pankhuri will in most cases, remove your
              information from its "live" database, but residual information may remain in archives and records.
              Pankhuri may not be able to propagate changes to your registration information to its co-brand partners
              who have received such information. In addition, if your account is being terminated for violations of the
              Agreement, Pankhuri may keep some of your registration information active to prevent re-registration.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Your Opinions</h2>
            <p>
              All information you submit as part of an Opinion is automatically displayed on the site (so long as it
              passes the software filters). Pankhuri may use such information in accordance with the license granted in
              the Agreement. This includes the right to use the Opinion or teaser portions (including your identity and
              photo) throughout the site, on other sites on the web, and offline. If you have registered through a
              co-branded site, please be aware that Pankhuri may be required to transfer your Opinions to the co-brand
              partner for their use and display. Subject to the limitations discussed in the Agreement, you can change
              an Opinion at any time using the tools available to you on each Opinion page. If you wish to delete an
              Opinion, you may request on a case-by-case basis. Your request may or may not be granted, depending on the
              reason of your request. In all cases, Pankhuri will protect your privacy, as laid down in this policy.
              However, if the Opinion has been transferred to other sites or parties, your changes may not propagate to
              these other places.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Comments on Opinions</h2>
            <p>
              Posting comments to other people's Opinions automatically displays your identity. This is true even if you
              have rated the Opinion anonymously. Pankhuri may choose to transfer your comments to third parties if
              Pankhuri transfers the associated Opinion.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Your Personal Profile Pages</h2>
            <p>
              Pankhuri allows you to display a large variety of personal information about yourself through the tools
              that edit your personal profile page. As you can see when you edit your preferences on this page, you have
              choices about whether to display or hide this information, and you can change this information at any time
              (although, as discussed elsewhere, it may not be possible to propagate all of these changes instantly or
              ever). Please note that whatever URL you choose to link to your photo will cause that photo to be
              displayed in many places throughout the site (not just on the personal profile page).
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Pankhuri does not transfer your personal profile in total to third parties, but may transfer pieces of
              your personal profile page in accordance with your instructions, in situations similar to those described
              under the Registration Information heading above, or as described elsewhere in this Statement.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Your Rating of Others and the Trusted Circle</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most powerful aspects of the site is that it personalizes your experience based on your
              personal interests using the Trusted Circle. The system assesses your prior experiences on the site (as
              evidenced by how you've rated other Opinions or trusted/distrusted other members), and then uses these
              experiences to dynamically sort the database of Opinions for you based on those that are more likely to
              interest you. To do this, Pankhuri captures information about your interactions with other users and then
              processes this information each time you look for Opinions. The more you interact with others, the more
              personalized your subsequent uses of the site will be.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              In rating and commenting on others' Opinions, your Pankhuri-ID is displayed. This causes the Opinion
              author and all other viewers of the Opinion to see your rating. You can choose to hide your identity when
              rating on an Opinion-by-Opinion basis.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              You can also hide or reveal your identity in trusting and distrusting others across all people you trust.
              You can change your mind and hide/reveal your identity in trusting and distrusting others by following the
              instructions on the site. However, you cannot prevent from your Pankhuri-ID being displayed if another
              member trusts or distrusts you. Similarly, even if you choose to hide your Trusted and Distrusted Member
              list, the members who you trust and distrust will know that you trust or distrust them.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Except as otherwise contemplated in this Statement, Pankhuri does not transfer the complete database of
              rating and transactional information to others. However, the database is used throughout all of the sites
              Pankhuri operates or may operate in future, whether branded solely by Pankhuri, co-branded with others, or
              operated for others on a private-label basis.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Pankhuri-Points Credit Redemption</h2>
            <p>
              Pankhuri may ask you for additional information to process a request for Pankhuri-Points credit
              redemption. Pankhuri may choose to add such information to our database record about you, which will be
              treated the same as other business records. Without limiting the foregoing, Pankhuri uses your mailing
              address information to send you redeemed Pankhuri-Points credits and, in limited circumstances, other
              communications. Also, Pankhuri may choose to feature your Member ID in promotional materials (both online
              and offline) to highlight your earnings successes.

            <p>
              In a number of places, Pankhuri provides the option to receive an email when an activity occurs. For
              example, you can choose to be emailed if a specific other member writes an Opinion or a comment, or if a
              new Opinion is written on a certain product. If you choose to be notified when another member writes an
              Opinion or comment, that other members will be able to see that you've done so.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Integrated Services</h2>
            <p>
              Although Pankhuri doesn't currently offer any integrated services operated by third parties as part of
              your registration, Pankhuri expects to do so in the future. These could include functionality like a
              Pankhuri email account. In these circumstances, Pankhuri may transfer some or all of your registration
              information and other information to the third party to operate the integrated service if you choose to
              use these services.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Internal Analyses and Reports</h2>
            <p>
              Pankhuri uses all of the information in its databases, including personal information you've submitted,
              and other server and usage logs, to analyze the site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems,
              resolve disputes and address complaints, and prepare aggregated reports that are shared with others,
              including the management of Pankhuri.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Other Information</h2>
            <p>
              Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Statement (if any) may be found
              throughout the site. To the extent that, during your submission of information on the site, you are
              notified of privacy practices that are different from those described in this Privacy Statement, those
              alternative disclosures will govern that submission.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              There may be situations where Pankhuri collects data through a survey or similar process when the page
              does not link to this Statement. In those cases, unless you are informed otherwise, you should assume that
              Pankhuri treats all information from such pages as it treats its other valuable business records.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Of course, there are many other ways in which Pankhuri could get information from or about you that are
              not described elsewhere in this Statement. For example, you might send email through a customer service
              email address, or Pankhuri may get a complaint about you from a third party. Pankhuri's practices with
              respect to such information are pretty much as you'd expect Pankhuri uses and discloses this information
              in a commercially reasonable business manner.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Children</h2>
            <p>
              Pankhuri feels strongly about protecting the privacy of children and encourages kids to involve their
              parents in any interactive activity they participate in online. If you are 12 or younger and we collect
              your age information through the registration process, you are not eligible to use the site. If you are
              under 18, Pankhuri encourages you to use the site with the help of your parents or guardians of legal age,
              but you are not eligible to participate in the Pankhuri-Points program.

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Contractors and Third Party Service Providers</h2>
            <p>
              Pankhuri uses contractors to help with its operations. Some or all of these contractors may access the
              databases of user information. Usually these contractors will enter into an agreement that places
              restrictive provisions on their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through the
              relationship.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Pankhuri may also use third party service providers to help with certain aspects of its operations that
              may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, Pankhuri may use a third party
              service provider to mail Pankhuri-Points redemption rewards, serve ads, or deliver some or all of the
              emails sent as part of the site's normal operation. Again, usually Pankhuri will place extensive
              restrictions on the ability of these third parties to use and disclose your personal information except as
              necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">The "Corporate Family"</h2>
            <p>
              Pankhuri may share some or all of your information with its subsidiaries or parent company (if any in
              future), in which case Pankhuri will ask such entities to honor the promises in this Statement. In
              addition, as part of a diligence review, Pankhuri may disclose some or all of your personal information to
              a potential acquirer or merger partner, although in this case Pankhuri would try to restrict their use and
              disclosure of this information.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Government Relations and Lawsuits</h2>
            <p>
              In some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of information about you, and of course Pankhuri
              will need to comply. However, irrespective of those situations, Pankhuri can unilaterally turn over
              information about you to the government if it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case
              you authorize it to do so. You also consent to Pankhuri disclosing information about you to actual or
              potential parties to a lawsuit that Pankhuri is or may become involved in (a) if it is required to do so,
              (b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to
              enforce its rights.

          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-4">Collecting Personal Information from the Site</h2>
            <p>
              Many friendships have developed through the site, and Pankhuri wants the community to be vibrant and
              engaged. Thus, Pankhuri is delighted when users begin communicating with each other outside the context of
              the site. However, not every user wants to engage in these types of dialogue, and Pankhuri believes each
              user should have the right to set the boundaries that feel right to them. Thus, you may not collect, use
              or store any personal information about other users on the site for any purpose whatsoever unless the user
              invites you to do so. Thus, if a user displays an email address in his or her personal profile, you can
              assume that the user is willing to receive a single personal email from you that has some relation to the
              site. However, without that user's permission, you may not contact the user about something that has
              nothing to do with Pankhuri, store that user's contact information in a database for further
              communications, or continue to contact the user if they have requested you not to. In all circumstances,
              as described in the Agreement, you may not use robots, scripts or other automated procedures to collect
              any information, including user contact information, from the site. You may also not email users inviting
              them to join your own review site under any circumstance-doing so is a theft of Pankhuri's valuable rights
              and an affront to users. Pankhuri will protect its users' interests-and its own interests-very vigorously
              in this regard.

            <p>
              Pankhuri may provide you with some tools that allow you to send emails to your friends. If you use this
              tool, the email will include your email address, as well as any personal message you choose to include.
              Pankhuri does not store, in any easily-retrievable way, the email addresses of the friends you are
              communicating with. You may not use these tools to send spam or to send content that would violate the
              Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not send "Tell a Friend" invitations to anyone who
              would not welcome the message or post any invitations to any websites, message boards, mail lists or
              USENET groups (unless you are the owner of that venue). In any case, you should not assume that emails
              processed by Pankhuri are private communications.

            <p>
              A site and service as complicated as Pankhuri is never perfect, and thus Pankhuri may inadvertently make
              uses or disclosures of your information in ways not contemplated by, or in direct contravention of, this
              Statement. For example, if the software has a temporary glitch, your personal information could be
              displayed on the site even though you've configured your preferences otherwise. Pankhuri might also make
              ad hoc uses of your information in ways it can't contemplate here. Pankhuri will do its best to work with
              you if these types of situations arise, but your sole remedy in these cases is to have Pankhuri try to
              rectify the problem as soon as it can.
            </p>

              In addition, although highly unlikely, it is possible for Internet transmissions containing your personal
              information to be intercepted by others. It is impossible for Pankhuri to ensure the privacy and security
              of all transmissions made to and from the site while in transit.
